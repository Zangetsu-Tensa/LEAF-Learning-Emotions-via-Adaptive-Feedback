# 🌿 LEAF — Learning Emotions via Adaptive Feedback
LEAF is a reinforcement learning framework that integrates emotional modeling into agent decision-making. The goal is to create agents that adapt their strategies dynamically based on simulated emotional states such as curiosity, frustration, or confidence.
>_“Just as a leaf adapts to its environment, this agent learns through emotion.”_

**LEAF** is an **Emotion-Aware Reinforcement Learning Framework** that integrates human-like emotional dynamics into RL agents.  
The goal is to enable agents that **feel, adapt, and learn** — improving exploration, decision-making, and adaptability through **emotion-driven feedback**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Traditional reinforcement learning focuses purely on rewards.  
LEAF introduces an additional layer — **Emotion Modeling** — that allows agents to adjust their learning patterns based on internal emotional signals such as **curiosity, frustration, or confidence**.

This creates agents that:
- Adapt more intelligently to changing environments  
- Explore efficiently without manual tuning  
- Exhibit behavior closer to human learning psychology

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 🧩 **Emotion Module** — Models agent “emotions” as latent states influencing learning and decision-making  
- 🔁 **Adaptive Feedback Loop** — Dynamically adjusts reward shaping and exploration rate based on emotional feedback  
- 🌍 **Plug-and-Play Environments** — Seamless integration with OpenAI Gym and custom RL environments  
- 📈 **Emotion Analytics Dashboard** — Visualize emotional states, rewards, and policy shifts over time

- **Emotion Module:** Converts state/reward trajectories into emotional vectors  
- **Adaptive Policy:** Adjusts learning rate, exploration, or reward shaping  
- **Feedback Loop:** Reinforces behaviors aligned with positive emotional outcomes
